\title{Build a table describing a cellular network}
\usage{
cellularNetworkTable(lr, autocrine = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lr}{The data.frame output by
\code{"\link{assignCellTypesToInteractions}"}.}

\item{autocrine}{A logical indicating whether autocrine interactions should
be included.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing all the links in the cellular network. A
link is created between two cell types as soon as there was a L-R interaction
that was associated with both cell types. The link is given a score
equal to the geometric mean of each cell type assignment r2.
}
\description{
Generate a data.frame including all the links between cell types
mediated by L-R interactions with their respective weights.
