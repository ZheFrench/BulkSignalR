\arguments{
\item{pairs}{A ligand-receptor table such as output by
\code{LRinter(BSRInference)}.}

\item{pw}{A table defining the reference pathways.}

\item{t.genes}{Target gene list such as output by
\code{tGenes(BSRInference)}.}

\item{tg.corr}{Target gene correlation list (with the receptor) such as
output by \code{tgCorr(BSRInference)}.}

\item{id.col}{Column index or name in \code{pw} for the pathway IDs.}

\item{gene.col}{Column index or name in \code{pw} for the gene symbols.}

\item{min.cor}{Minimum correlation required for the target genes.}

\item{tg.pval}{Target gene P-value list such as returned by
\code{ tgPval(BSRInferenceComp)}.}

\item{max.pval}{Maximum (regulation) P-value for target genes in case
A BSRInferenceComp object is used to generate the network.}
}
\value{
An \code{igraph} object featuring the ligand-receptor-downstream
signaling network. Default colors and node sizes are assigned. In case
the \code{max.pval} parameter is set, it is assumed that \code{tg.pval}
is set as well and downstream signaling genes are selected by their
P-values in the comparison of clusters of samples.
