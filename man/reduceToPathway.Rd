\title{Aggregate ligands and receptors at the pathway level}
\usage{
reduceToPathway(pairs)
}
\arguments{
\item{pairs}{A ligand-receptor table such as output by \code{pValuesLR}.}
}
\value{
A table with the same structure as \code{pairs} but reduced to only report one row per pathway.
All the ligands and all the receptors forming pairs related to a certain pathway, are combined in two semi-colon-separated
lists surrounded by curly braces. The information of which ligand interacted with which receptor is lost.
For a given pathway, the reported P-values and target genes are those of the best ligand-receptor pair that
was in this pathway.

There is no pathway selection, i.e. potentially redundant pathways with different P-values
are all kept in the output. \code{reduceToBestPathway()} can be used to select the one with best P-value.
}
\description{
Simplifies a ligand-receptor table to focus on the pathways.
