\title{BulkSignalR: A package to infer ligand-receptor interactions from bulk transcriptomics or proteomics}
\description{
Inference of ligand-receptor (LR) interactions from bulk
(transcriptomic or proteomic) data. BulkSignalR bases its inferences
on the LRdb database. It relies on a statistical model that
is specific to bulk data sets. Different visualization and data
summary functions are proposed to help navigating results.
