\details{
Estimates the model parameters that are stored in the
  slot \code{param}.

  In a reference pathway, i.e., a Reactome pathway or the genes of a
  GOBP term, the target genes are the genes coding for proteins forming a
  complex with the receptor and the genes in the pathway downstream the
  receptor, which are given as regulated by the pathway. If
  \code{with.complex} is set to \code{FALSE}, then only the regulated genes
  are considered. Participation to a complex, being regulated, and
  pathway directed topologies are defined by Reactome and KEGG pathways
  as provided by PathwayCommons.

  The \code{min.pw.size}, \code{max.pw.size}, and \code{min.positive}
  parameters should be identical to the
  values intended when searching for ligand-receptor pairs with
  \code{\link{.getCorrelatedLR}}) and  \code{\link{.checkReceptorSignaling}})
  Although the statistical distributions are rather robust, it is not
  advisable to use different parameters that could introduce unanticipated
  biases, but for saving compute time and exploring.

  The maximum pathway size is used to limit the redundancy inherent to GOBP
  and Reactome. The minimum pathway size is used to avoid overspecific,
  noninformative results.

  BulkSignalR approach relies on modeling (Spearman) correlations and
  different models of null distributions are available for this purpose
  (parameter \code{null.model}). By default, the "automatic" option is
  selected meaning that censored normal and mixed normal as well as
  an empirical model based on Gaussian kernels (R \code{density()} function)
  are compared to pick the one closest to the data. Preference is given
  to normal and then mixture of normal over the empirical version for
  comparable quality of fit. It is also to bypass the automatic selection.
  Fitting of an alpha-stable distribution is quite time consuming as the
  computation of its PDF is compute-intensive. Finally, in the automaic
  selection mode, the choice of the actual model will be done based on
  the L-R null assuming a similar shape for the R-T null (with
  different parameters though, unless \code{quick} was set to \code{TRUE}).
