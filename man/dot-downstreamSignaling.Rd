\arguments{
\item{lr}{A data frame as returned by
\code{.getCorrelatedLR()}.}

\item{pw}{A table defining the reference pathways.}

\item{pw.size}{A named vector with pathway sizes (names are pathway
IDs).}

\item{rncounts}{A matrix of normalized read counts with at
least all the ligands, receptors, and genes in the reference pathways.}

\item{id.col}{Column index or name in \code{pw} for the pathway IDs.}

\item{gene.col}{Column index or name in \code{pw} for the gene
symbols.}

\item{pw.col}{Column index or name in \code{pw} for the pathway
names.}

\item{min.positive}{Minimum number of target genes to be found in a given
pathway.}

\item{with.complex}{A logical indicating whether receptor co-complex
members should be included in the target genes.}
}
\value{
A table reporting all the ligand-receptor pairs provided in \code{lr}
  along with the pathways found and data about target gene correlations with
  the receptor.
