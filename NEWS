INHBE   ACVR2B
INHBE   ACVR2B
SEMA4A   PLXND1
PVR     CD96
INHBE   ACVR2B

Spotted some inversions in description for SEMA4A PLXNB1 interaction.
Also ACVR2B was found with different descriptions whereas gene name occurs several times.
So Description for each gene was rewritten once according to biomart. 

Change according to multichecker (https://www.genenames.org/tools/multi-symbol-checker/)
Note HLAE was changed to HLA-E.
Note BY55 was changed to CD160.
Note MTf was changed to MELTF.
Note SHP1 was changed to PTPN6.
Note SHP2 was changed to PTPN11.
Note TIM-1 was changed to HAVCR1.
Ambiguous (failed with multichecker):
Note NOV was changed to CCN3 according to (hugo,omnipath,celltalk)
