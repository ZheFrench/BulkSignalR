#' BulkSignalR: A package to infer ligand-receptor interactions from bulk transcriptomics or proteomics
#'
#' Inference of ligand-receptor (LR) interactions from bulk
#' (transcirptomic or proteomic) data. BulkSignalR bases its inferences
#' on the LRdb database included in our other package, SingleCellSignalR
#' available from Bioconductor. It relies on a statistical model that
#' is specific to bulk data sets. Different visualization and data
#' summary functions are proposed to help navigating prediction results.
