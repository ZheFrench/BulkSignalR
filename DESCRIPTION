Description: Inference of ligand-receptor (LR) interactions from bulk
    (transcriptomic or proteomic) data. BulkSignalR bases its inferences
    on the LRdb database included in our other package, SingleCellSignalR
    available from Bioconductor. It relies on a statistical model that
    is specific to bulk data sets. Different visualization and data
    summary functions are proposed to help navigating prediction results.
