Inference of ligand-receptor (LR) interactions from bulk
(transcirptomic or proteomic) data. BulkSignalR bases its inferences
on the LRdb database included in our other package, SingleCellSignalR
available from Bioconductor. It relies on a statistical model that
is specific to bulk data sets. Different visualization and data
summary functions are proposed to help navigating prediction results.

## Installation

You can install the released version of BulkSignalR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("BulkSignalR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(BulkSignalR)
## basic example code
```
