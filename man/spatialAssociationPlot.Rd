\title{Heatmap plot of association of scores with area labels}
\usage{
spatialAssociationPlot(
  associations,
  qval.thres = 0.01,
  absval.thres = 0,
  colors = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{associations}{A statistical association data.frame generated
by the function \code{spatialAssociation}.}

\item{qval.thres}{The maximum Q-value to consider in the plot (a
L-R interaction must associate with one label at least with a Q-value
smaller or equal to this threshold).}

\item{absval.thres}{The minimum value to consider in the plot (a
L-R interaction must associate with one label at least with an absolute
value larger or equal to this threshold).}

\item{colors}{A function returning a color for a given value such as
generated by \code{circlize::colorRamp2}.}
}
\description{
Plot a heatmap featuring Q-values 
or values of statistical association between
L-R interaction score spatial distributions and tissue area labels.
}
\details{
Display a heatmap linking L-R interactions to labels.
